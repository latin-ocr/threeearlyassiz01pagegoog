ranraon. XV

The laws oi the Marches were settled in 1249, hut, notwith-
standing their provisions, rsids on either side oi the border
seem to have been frequent, and the evil oi the escape of
felons from one kingdom into the other to have remained
unremedied, as will be seen from a study of the entries on
the rolls here printed. But what perhaps affected the
county oi Nerthumberland at this time as much as anything

was themaniage between the young Princess Margaret of
England with the youthful King Alexander oi Scotland,
which toolr place at Christmas 1251, and appeared at the

time to be so heneficial to both countries‚ but the result oi

sent Simon de Montiort and Gilbert de Segrave on an
embassy to advise the young King, and these were followed

him to lend his castle oi Wark ior depositing of wine and
victuale, preparatory to the King’s visit to Scotland. Largo
stores of provisions were laid up at Wark by William Heron,
the Sheriff oi Nerthumberland, and in order that the King
and his retinue might be well provided, it was ordered that
no marhet should be held in the counties oi York, (lumber-
land, Westmoreland, and Nerthumberland while the King
should be in scotland, but all persons having goods for sale
should bring them to the King. Henry arrived at York on
12 August, and here he issued an order that all knights and
others owing him service should attend with horses and arms,
