ernour attemptiug to solve the involved question of the

Ι origin of the various Oourts of Justice in this country, it

may be well to trace the administration of justice in the
county of Nerthumberland from a date a little previous to

· that of the Assize Rolls here dealt with. The earliest men·

tion we have of auy court held in the country north of the
Teos is that in which the Plocitc Comitatus were heard in
1080 at Gateshead, when Bishop Waloher, theu Elarl of

Ι - Nerthumberland, was murdered.

This shira-gamot, or Oouuty Ocurt, at which the Placita
comitatmj were brought forwerd, was, till the forfeiture of
Robert de Mowbray and during the time the Earldom of
Nerthumbcrland was in the-hands of Henry and Malcolm of

' Sootland, probably the highest, if not the only, court held in

the county. From the Pipc Rolls we learn that pleas were
held before Walter Espec and Eustace riez J ohn in 1129, and
pleas of the forest in 1158. The Assize of eluendos, which
remodelled the provincial administration of justice, was held
in 1166, and almost immediately afterwards pleae for the
county of Nerthumberland were heard before Elarl Geoffrey
de Mandeville and Richard de Lucy, the justitiare Ex-
cepting the inquest of eherills in 1170, the next visitation of
the justices to the county was in 1176, when pleas were held
before Ranulph Glanvill and his fellow·justioes, described as
Jucticv'arii Errantem at this assiae the articles of the eyre
appear to have been very rigidly carried out, judging from
the long list of heavy fines then leried.⁹ The King’s justices
