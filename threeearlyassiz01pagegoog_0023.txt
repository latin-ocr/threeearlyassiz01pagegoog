escaped with the slight punishment of outlawry. On the
same roll we find 78 cases of bnrglary, theft, eto, in twelve
of which cases the felons were hanged, in fourteen they

abjured the malm, and in the remaining 52 they escaped with
only the punishment of ontlawry. In the Pleas of the
Orown ior 7 Edward I. there are recorded 68 cases of
murder3 in which one murderer abjured the realm, two
were hanged, and 65 escaped with outlawry. On the same
roll are 110 cases oi burglary‚ theit, eto, in 15 of which the
“ islons abjured‚ in 20 they were hanged, and in the remain-
ing 75 they escaped with outlawry. The enormous per-
contage oi nnpunished crime which these figures show is to
be largely accounted for by the peculiar position oi the
oounty, from which it became a matter oi comparative ease
ior a felon to escape to some place where the King's writ
did not run. On the north was the Kingdom of Sootland,
on the south the Palatinate oi Durham, and between these
were the small liberties of Hermam, Tynemouth, Tynedale,
Carham and Norhamshire, Islandshire and Bedlingtonshire.
Oi all these “ the Grithcros of Tynemouth '' was the worst
offender in receiving fugitive ‘ielons3 there were received
here not only malefactore from the cormty, but those fleeing
for their misdeeds from other liberties.l Tho existence oi such
franchises rendered the suppression oi felony in the county ex-
tremely difficult, if not impossible, and loolring at these small
liberties in this light, itis not surprising that the legislative
mind oi Edward I. should have endeavoured to curtail their
power by the Statutes oi Westminster and Glouoester. This
ease of escape for telone necessitated a ready means of
punishing felony, somewhat aiter the style of Lynch law.
There arc several instsnoes on these rolls of felons, caught
as it were red-handed, being beheaded on the spot without
any attempt at a trial. From one of these it appears that a
stranger‚ named Gilbert de Niddesdal, while walking across
aoertain moor with Semanus de Bottelesham, a hermit‚
attached and robbed him, and left him thero stunned and
