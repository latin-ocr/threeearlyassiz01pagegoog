1191199. xxi

William 19 Valence, took a man who wished 19 replevy some
cattle, and put him in a cell until he had made a fine 191 his
release, and took another man and tied him 19 9 9991, 991
191999119 191 any one replevy him until the man’s master 1191
91919 9 199 1911991 marks3 the jurors conclude by'saying
that many other horrible prises he took 11919 the 9199 91 the
ecunty whereof there is 99 99191191.1 Similar complaints
were also made against Gilbert de Umfravill and his bailliis.
A 9999 91 extraordinarily arbitrury conduct occurs in the
1911191411 Henry ΙΙΙ.2 Two women complained that Thomas
19 Β1191199 took them and another woman 99 suspicion 91
theth, and kept 11191919 a cell at Bikertcn 1911991 days with-
9911991 91 1119199111 then sent them 19 Newcastle geel,
where one woman and a suckling child 91 another died.
Thomas aoknowledged the imprisonment‚ but said the women
had robbed him; the jurem, however, said that the two com·

plainants were innocent, but they suspected the woman who
died in prison. Thomas de Bilrertcn got 911 by making a

fine with the King 191 sixty marks, 191 which he had to give
twenty pledges. Raids 91 Scotch robbers (malefactores iyaoti
dc Scotic) are constantly mentioned 99 these 19119. The
usual method 91 these 1911919 appears to have been, probably
when opposition was 991 offered to them, to take all the
members 91 a household‚ bind them hand 9911991, 991 then
19999911 the house. There was little chance 91 their being

caught, but even should they not 999 their way 91 immediately
escaping back into Scotland, there was generally a church
near by, at which they could take sanctmrry, and assoon 99
the coroner could be brought to them they abjured the
realm and made the best 91 their way to their native
country.

These 19119 give us an idea 91 99199 91 the industries and
trades 91 the inhabitants 91 Nerthumberland during the
period they cover. The trade 91 Newcastle at this time has
been ably noted by Mr. Hodgson Hinde‚³ and it will be found
that these 19119 exemplify many 91 his statements 99191119
