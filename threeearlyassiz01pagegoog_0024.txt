nalred3 but as Gilbert was fleeing away he was taken on
suspicion by a King’s serjeant and carried to Alnwiclr.
Upon the hermit recovering consciousness he went to
Alnwiclr‚ where he found Gilbert and accused him of robbery,
and, as Gilbert made confession, the sery'eant caused the
hermit to cut off his head, in reward for which he received
Gilbert's clothes.l The sheriff and coroner both attested to
this being the custom of the county. Another summary
punishment was when a person, suspected of felony, was
taken and escaped from custody3 if he then happened to be
retalren, he was hanged at once without any form of trial.
This latter custom‚ however, does not seemco have deterred
prisoners from escaping from gaol, which was apparently
by no means a· difficolt task. Notwithstanding that the
gaol of Newcastle was just rebuilt,² there are constant
references to persons escaping therefrom to one of the
churches and abjuring the realm, or else obtaining sanctuary
in Durham or Tynemouth.

There are frequent and universal complaints both on the
rolls here printed and the Hundred rolls³ for Northumber-
land of the extortion and arbitrary conduct of the sheriffs3

' that they imprisoned innocent people and allowed felons

to escape, for the cause of gain, took gifts from divers
persons that they might not be made knights, and appro-
priated public moneys. According to the complaints it
would seem that William Heron was the most unscrupulous.
It was particularly brought to his charge, that whereas the
county, before he was sheriff, was quit of sheriff’s turns, he
caused the free tenants and to'wnships to attend two turns
by the year, and those who did not come he heuvily amerced
as hc pleased ; however, upon an appeal to Henry HI. the
county was relieved of this service. Extortion, equal to that
of the sheriffs, is complained of against the great lords of the
county and their bailiffs. William de Houton, bailiff of
