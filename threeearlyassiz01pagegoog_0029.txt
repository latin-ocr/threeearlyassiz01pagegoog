meraca. XXV

An almost romantio story of abduction occurs in the last
of these rolla¹ A certain lady, who is called both by the
name of Dionisia de Bechfeld and of Dionisia deBa, while
returning from Newcastle‚ where she had been in pledge
before Maater de Seyton, accompanied by her uncle, Master

John de Papingham‚ when on Milburn Moor, near a bridge
called Opinetheleche, was met by a band of young men, who
carried her off to a place called Illyscaghe in the Liberty of
Redesdale, where Walter de Swethop was steward3 and there

for the same in the Oourt of Redesdale, which aum she for-
feited by default. Byfreason of all this, she pleads, she was

with Dionisia for 20 marks, and with the King for 1000. Ι

or Ba was. From herpledges, via, John de nerle, Walter de
Tynedale, and J ohn de Lethgreyns‚ it would appear she was
a person of some standing in the connty. rl'be only additional
