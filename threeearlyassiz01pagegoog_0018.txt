an uncle and a sou of au aunt of the same Geoffrey, who
acknowledged themselves his villeins and nativas. And
Geoffrey came, the record alleged, and aclmowledged that
his grandfather and father were natives of the said Henry's
father, buthe said the same Henry had freed him ; and be-
cause he could shew no manumission it was considered by
the eounty court that Henry should recover Geoffrey as his
native and fugitive, with his goods and sequels. And
Geoffrey and the suitors of the whole county came before
the justiam, and the suitors avowcd the record. And
Geoffrey said that they had made a false judgment and
falsely recorded the plea, and that they withheld what was
in his favour and recorded that which was against him,
because, he said, he never acknowledged that' his grand-
father or father were villeins, but said they were free men.
And because it appeared that the county crred in the afore·
said process in admitting Henry's narrative, in which he
made no mention of the name of Geoffrey’s grandfather, and
also because it admitted the proof of Henry from the son of
an uncle of Geoffrey without saying whether the son of
Geoffrey’s uncle was on the mother's or father’s side, and
gave no names, and because they assumed to themselves
power of adjudging of the liberty of a man, in that by rea-
son Geoffrey could shew no manumission, they adjudged him
to Henry as his villein, of taking which proof they had uo
power, and lihewise because Geolfrey had obtained a writ

· da libertate arsa motando fifteen days before the county court

pronounced judgment, it was considered that the aforesaid
county court gave a false judgment, and therefore that
Geoffrey should be in the same state as he was at the time

’ the judgment was made, and the whole county court was
amerced.

The King's justioes had not visited Northumberland for
ten years previous to the date of the first Assine Roll here
printed. During that time Henry had been constantly at
varianae with his subjects, the result of which differences
was the solemn confirmation of the Great Oharter in 1253.
