visited Nerthumberland at intervals varying from seven
to ten years, from this time till the reign oi King John,
when the interval was reduced to about three years. Whether
these early visitations were those oi the Caria Regis, the
King’s Bench, or of justices specially directed to hear pleae in
the county, from what is at present known of the history
of the English Oourts, it is impossible to say: when the early
plea rolls have been further examined some conclusione may
. be more safely arrived at. All that is as yet known on this
subject has been ably dealt with by Dr. Stubbs and Professor
Maitland.

With the accession of Henry 111. the procedure of the
various oourts became settled, and from this date we hare
an almost nnbroken chain of recorda of all the comte, the
system oi enrolling writs and charters, legal proceedings
and judgments, and the revenue accountS, was also enforced.
ht the commencement oi the reign eyres were held through-
out England3 and on 8 November 1218 a writ was issued
to the sheriff of the oounty of Northumberland commanding

· him to be attendant upon Richard, Bishop of Durham,

Robert de Vipont, and others, the King's justices itinerant,
who were about to visit the oounty.¹ Later visitatione also
occurred in the eleventh, the nineteenth, the twenty-fifth,
the thirtieth, the fortieth, and the fifty-third years of King
Henry IH.; the proceedings at the two last of which are
here printed, they being the earliest Assize Rolls for·the
oounty of Northumberland as yet known to exist.

The lile of an assiae judge in the thirteenth century was
certainly an active one3 as Professor Maitland points out² in
speaking ol the Judge Martin Pateshull, “the amount of
hard riding, let alone justice, that he had done is almost
beyond belief.'' The same words may be equally applied to
many other jndges of the same century, whom we find hold-
