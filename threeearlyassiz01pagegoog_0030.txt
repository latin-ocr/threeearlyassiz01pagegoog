Swethop did not afterwards gain her hand either by force or
persuasion.

Tho thanlrs of the Society are greatly due to his Gracc
the Duke of Nerthumberland for the loen of his transcripte
ot these rolls, from which a copy in extended Latin has been
made, and examined, in all cases of doubt, with the original
rolis at the Public Record Office. I cannot too strongly
express my gratitnde to our Secretary for his ever ready
assistance end advice in passing these sheets through the
prees. My thanlrs are also dne to Mr. Scargill-Bird and Mr.
Overend of the Public Record Office for their assistance in the
deciphering of faded words and the extensiones obscure pas·
seges. In conclusion, let me ask the indulgence of the
membcrs of the Society ior any mistakes which may be
found in thisvolume, it being the first work of the nature
which I have undertaken3 it may be borne in mind, however,
that all the error· are not those of the Editor, for in many
instances they will be found to have been committed by the
judge’s clerlr who wrote the original rolls.
