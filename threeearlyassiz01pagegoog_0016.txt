was sent into the llxchequer together with a roll for the
King called the Rex Roll. In the first two of the eyres, of
which the rolls for Northumberland are here printed, there
is only one roll of that county for each, now extant at the
Public Record Office,¹ but for the third, there exist tour rolla,
namely, the roll ot John de Vallibus⁹ (which is the one here
printed), and the rolls of William de sabam, Roger Loveday,
and John de Metingham. Each of these four rolls differs
from the others in the wording of the proceedings and the
arrangement of the cases, but the difference is very slight.
The roll ot John de Vallibus is the one chosen, because he
was the chief of the justioes whose rolls are extant, and it is
also the fullest3 those of Mettingham and Loveday contaiu
rather more foreign pleae. The rolls are made up in what is
termed Exchequer fashion, that is, they are composed of long
strips of parchment all bound together at the top; on the
left-hand side of each membrane is a margin in which is
entered the result ot the plea or presentment, and the amount
of the fines, amercements‚ deodands, eto. These marginal
notes have not been printed, except iu cases where addi-
tional information is given, as they are only a repetition of
what is contained in the body of the membrane.

The assiae court appears to have been held in the most
central and convenient part of the town. In the summer
time it was probably held in the open air, usually at the
market cross. In 1231 pleas were heard for the liberty of
Ripon at the cross ot Ripon,³ and in 1268 they were heard at
the stone cross of the Strand, Irondon.4 In May 1271 there
ismention of assizes being taken in the common hall at
Bristol,⁵ and in 1295 at the bridge of Amot in Westmore·
land.⁶ When the pleas concerned the possessione of some
religious liberty we find they were heard, for the convenience

ot the canons, either at the entrance of the church of such
religious body or within the church itself. In J uly 1278
