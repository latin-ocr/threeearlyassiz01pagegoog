Henry HI. of the siege of Alnwiclr in connection witha
curicus story about young Gilbert de Umtravill, llari of
Augus, and William de Douglas, father of Sir William de
Douglas‚ the abductor of Alianora de Perrars. The story

which has been noted by Praser and Bain is bricfly this z the .

young Earl accused Dongles of being against the King, and

asked Princo Edward at the siege of Alnvviclr Castle for ·

Douglas's mancr of Paudom which he held of the Earl.

’ Princo Edward consented upon condition that the accusation

was true, but upon inquiry being made, it was found that
Donglas never was against the King, consequently he was
re-seized of his lands. 'Phercupon Gilbert maden raid on
Donglas's lands and bur-nt his house, wounded his son, the
famous Sir William, and his attendants. Dcuglas first
brought an action against Gilbert in the Oounty Ocurt, then
before the King at westminster, both of which suits failed
on technical points, and it was not till he brought his action

· before the the justices of assiae that he recovered sciren of

his lands, and damages from Gilbert. 'Phis is not the only
instance of the Elarl of Angus’s indiscreet real in the royal
cause, as we find he made a similar accusation against his
steward, Walter de Swethope, imprisoned him at Harbottle‚
and extorted from him 100 marks} There is little from this
date till after the time of the last of the three Assize Rolls
here printed which bears particularly on the history of the
county of Nerthumberland.

The most important aspect of these rolls to the historiari
is the picture they give us of the social life in Nor-thumber-
land during the period they cover. The inefficiency of the
criminal law at this time, to which Professor Maitland has
called our attention,2 is well exemplified by these rolls. In
the Pleas of the Orown for aoth Henry ΙΠ. there are recorded
77 murders, for only four of which did the murderers receive

their just punishment3 in one case the murderer abjured
the realm, and in the remaining 72 cases the murderers
