the Orown, which'in this particular case, from the fines,

, county of Northumberland, amounted to the large sum for
that time of osolt. 33. lod. We learn from the Pipe Rolls

Nicholas de Boltby, William de Scrutevill, John de Balliol,
Peter de Percy, Roger de Merlay, and William de Hunter-

Crown and Simon de Montfort. The two parties seemcd to
have been pretty evenly divided in the county3 probably

holding the wardship oi the large estates of young Gilbert
de Umfravill. Amongst those ior the King were John,
Eustace, and Hugh de Balliol, John and Richard Cumyn,
Robert de Bruce, Adam de Gesemue, and John de Lede-
